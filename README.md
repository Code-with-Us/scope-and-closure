# Scope and Closure on Code with Us

## What is this?

This repository is the home of a set of notes and code snippets put together while reading the sources listed in the [Reading List](reading-list.md)

Because this set of notes was intended to help me become familiar with these concepts and isn't intended for broad distribution, in places I've lifted lines and paragraphs directly from the articles contained in that list without attribution. Please note that all of the books and articles listed in the [Reading List](reading-list.md) were enormously helpful.
